# Raising Issues and Bug Reports

Please, use the issue templates provided in the repository when raising issues. These templates are structured in a way
that both helps you while [Gathering Requirements] and encourages you to provide as much information as possible
regarding the work.

Make sure there is clear description of the efforts, a reasonable breakdown of the work via `Task List`-s, keep record 
of findings via `Notes`, `Useful Commands` and `Useful Links` and add `Points of Contact`, who can help in case the
person working on this task gets stuck. If there are any inclarities, add them to the `Open Questions` section, so they
can be discussed.

Also, please make sure you update your issues regularly, with any findings, especially if you're doing research,
as issues are part of the knowledge base and a well-described issue can often serve as a good reference for future
tasks that may be related to it.

## Raising Issues

Typically, there are more unknowns surrounding new tasks, so, please try to provide as much information
as possible, following the [Gathering Requirements] article. It is important for everyone as it will provide a better
understanding of the required efforts, as well as clarity.

## Raising Bugs Reports

When raising bugs, please, provide as much information as possible, including:

* Steps to reproduce the bug
* Screenshots
* Logs (please, add logs as text, not as screenshots)

## Organising Issues and Bugs

When working on a larger chunk of work, which is anticipated to have many tasks that will need to be raised, it is often
a good idea to create a new Github Project and add these tasks to it. This way, it is easier to track the progress of
the overall work and it is easier to understand work still needs to be done, as well as how other developers can be
allocated to the project so that there can be quicker progress.
