# Automations

## Overview
The "Automations" feature in Kinsend offers a flexible way to craft automated text message workflows. Designed with user experience in mind, it allows users to intuitively create, manage, and visualize multiple text message automation funnels.

## Features

### 1. Create Multiple Automations
Users can seamlessly set up multiple text message automations to cater to various scenarios. The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to get started with creating automations in just a few clicks.

### 2. Toggle Automation
- **Enable/Disable**: Each automation is accompanied by a convenient toggle. This feature empowers users to quickly activate or deactivate specific automations based on their immediate requirements.

### 3. Edit Automation
- **Flexible Editing**: Beyond the initial setup, each automation can be fine-tuned to perfection. The `Change Title` button at the top allows users to name/rename the automation, giving a clear indication of its purpose or the segment it's meant for.
- **Action Selection**: The `Select Action` modal, evident from the screenshots, offers options like sending messages or introducing delays, allowing users to customize the actions that follow a trigger.

### 4. Delete Automation
The user interface provides a straightforward way to remove automations that are no longer in use, ensuring the workspace remains clutter-free.

### 5. Visual Workflow Builder
- **Intuitive Interface**: Users can visually map out their automation's journey using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- **Trigger**: Clearly denoted by the lightning icon, this represents the event that activates the automation.
- **Add Stop Trigger**: An option to introduce conditions that, when met, will halt the automation.
- **Tasks and Actions**: Users can append tasks post-trigger. Whether it's sending out a timely message or waiting for a specific duration, the interface supports it.

### 6. Triggers
- **Diverse Options**: Triggers form the heart of automation. Kinsend offers a variety of triggers to cater to different use-cases.
- **First Message**: Activated when a subscriber sends a message for the first time.
- **Contact Created**: Springs into action when a new contact joins.
- **Contact Tagged**: Engages when a subscriber receives a specific tag.
- **Stop Trigger**: This trigger can also include First Message, Contact Created, or Contact Tagged, but the only difference is that the stop trigger exits subscribers from an automation.

## 7. Messages

Crafting messages involves creating tailored content to be sent out as part of the automation. This could range from welcome messages, reminders, notifications, to follow-ups. The aim is to engage the recipient in a meaningful way.

Allows for a specific delay based on units of time. Users can define the delay in terms of:
